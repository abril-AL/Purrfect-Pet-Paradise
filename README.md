## Overview

"Purrfect Pet Paradise" is an immersive graphics based game that provides users the opportunity to take care of a virtual pet. We narrowed down on just cats for simplicity. Using the skills and techniques taught in class, such as physics-based animation and collision detection, this game aims to create an engaging environment where players can bond with their pet through various activities.

## Objectives
- Develop realistic physics based animations to enhance the interaction between the virtual cat and its environment.
- Implement robust collision detection to ensure smooth and believable movements and interactions.
- Design and integrate a variety of activities, including brushing the cat, playing with a ball, and feeding, to simulate the pet care experience.

## Key Features and Activities
- Physics-Based Animation
    - Realistic Movement: Simulate the cat's movements using physics based algorithms to create lifelike animations for walking, running, jumping, and playing. 
    - Environmental Interaction: Implement physics to allow the cat to interact with objects in the environment, such as toys and walking. 
- Collision Detection
    - Object Interaction: Ensure accurate collision detection to allow the cat to accurately / realistically interact with various objects, such as toys and food bowls.
    - User Actions: Detect collisions between the user's interactions (e.g., brushing, feeding) and the cat, making sure there is responsive and realistic feedback.

## Activities
1. Brushing 
    - User Interface: Create an interface where users select a grooming brush.
    - Cat's Reactions: Program the cat to react positively to brushing, showing animations of contentment and happiness, such as purring, closing its eyes, or moving ears.
2. Playing with a Ball
    - Interactive Toys: Develop a ball that the cat can chase, bat, and carry around.
    - Physics-Based Toy Movement: Simulate realistic toy movements, ensuring the ball bounces, rolls, and reacts to the cat's interactions and the environment.
    - User Engagement: Allow users to throw or roll the ball to the cat and watch the cat interact with it.
3. Feeding
    - Food Types: Offer various types of food, such as dry / wet food, and treats, each with unique properties and effects on the cat.
    - Feeding Mechanics: Implement a feeding process where users can place food in the bowl, and the cat will come to eat. 
4. Health and Happiness Metrics: Track the cat's health and happiness levels, providing feedback to the user based on their gameplay / care. 

## Technical Implementation
- Graphics and Animation: Utilize WebGL and TinyGraphics for rendering 3D models and animations. Develop cat models with smooth animations. Create a realistic environment making use of texture mapping and modeling.
- Vertex modeling, shading, transformations for movement
- Collision Detection: Implement collision detection algorithms to ensure precise interactions between the cat, objects, and user actions.
- User Interface: Design an intuitive and engaging user interface for interaction with the game, providing easy access to different activities and tools.


## Conclusion
"Purrfect Pet Paradise" aims to create an engaging simulation where users can experience the joys of taking care of a virtual cat. By incorporating advanced graphics techniques, physics based animation, and interactive activities, the game will offer a unique and enjoyable experience for cat lovers.
